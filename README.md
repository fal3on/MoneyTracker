# React Project: Expense Tracker

Long story short:
> I'm not a fan of linking my bank data with similar trackers so I build this in order to know why I was going broke... turns out I eat a lot of junk...

It currently works using **local storage**, and it's responsive so you can track your own expenses in your favorite browser (no account, linking or weird stuff needed).
